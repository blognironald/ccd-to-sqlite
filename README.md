# Chinese Character Decomposition TSV to Sqlite Tables in Haskell

## 📖 Overview
This project parses a **publicly available Chinese character decomposition file** and inserts the results into an **SQLite database** for further queries.  

The main purpose of this repository is to practice:
- 📝 Parsing structured text data in **Haskell**  
- 🗄️ Working with **SQLite** from Haskell  
- 🚀 Laying groundwork for a **Kanji/Hanzi learning tool** I would have wanted if I were to start over with my Japanese study

While the project is small in scope, it is designed as a stepping stone toward a larger language-learning application.

---

## ✨ Features
- ✅ Parse decomposition data for Chinese characters  
- ✅ Store decompositions in an SQLite database  
- ✅ Query decompositions using SQL  
- ✅ Written entirely in **Haskell** as a learning exercise  

---

## 🎯 Motivation
When learning **Japanese (and/or Chinese)**, understanding how characters are composed can make memorization easier.  
This project is an experiment in **parsing and database management**, but ultimately it ties into my idea for a future **Kanji/Hanzi study tool**.
